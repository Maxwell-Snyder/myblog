        <p>Some people in my class are using Zoom when they are not supposed too. Doesn't suprise me though... it seems like alot of people are trying to rebel today. I dont know what they are trying to achieve by being on a zoom, but good luck to them.

            <p>I'm honestly suprised that my school didn't call an early dismisall yet! I mean, there is alot of snow outside! The weather said 3-5 inches. Hopefully they call an early dismisall soon. I would like that alot.</p>
