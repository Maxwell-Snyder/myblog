	    <p>So I have a FNAF SB theory. What if Gregory from SB is actually a robot? There are a few pieces of evidence. First piece of evidence is when Gregory is hurt Glamrock Freddy tells him, "I feel you are broken". Another piece of evidence is Gregory's eyes glitch out when Vanny gets near. That is why I think Gregory is a robot.</p>

        <p>I'm having this one problem at school when they let us outside. There's this one annoying kid that wont leave us alone when we ask him to. My friends think it's a good idea to try to, "fight" him. this has been happening for a couple of days now. I really don't want to get in trouble.</p>

        <p>So my day has gotten better. The speech went well, my birthdays tomorrow and I got a fan in my room! I've also been thinking of adding a new thing to my blog called private posts. My posts be sensitive to some but not to others. Because of this it will be hiding behind a screen that says enter password. Just something that I'm thinking. See you later!</p>
