        <p>So my day has gotten better. The speech went well, my birthdays tomorrow and I got a fan in my room! I've also been thinking of adding a new thing to my blog called private posts. My posts be sensitive to some but not to others. Because of this it will be hiding behind a screen that says enter password. Just something that I'm thinking. See you later!</p>

        <p>OK I have good news and bad news. The good news is there is a new slope website that isn't blocked. The bad news is that I do have to read my speech today. Although I thnk I'll do alright. I let my friend check my speech overview and I have been practicing! Tell you how it goes when school is over!</p>
